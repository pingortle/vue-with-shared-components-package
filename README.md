# Shared Vue components example

- Sample app is a minimal Nuxt app. All the code is in `./app.vue`.
- The components are in a package called `@lape/components` within a npm workspace at `./components`.
- The components package doesn't currently pull in any dependencies of its own but relies on the parent app to compile components to simplify this minimal example.
- Start a discussion! Let me know what you think.
