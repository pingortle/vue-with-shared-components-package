# Shared Vue components example

### High points

Sample app is a minimal Nuxt app. All the code is in `./app.vue`.

The components are in a package called `@lape/components` within a npm
workspace at `./workspaces/components`.

The components package doesn't currently pull in any dependencies of its own
but relies on the parent app to compile components. This approach is
unrealistic, but helpful because this repo is focused on the integration
between Vue and the components. Besides, bundlers are a dime a dozen these
days. ðŸ˜„

Start a discussion! Let me know what you think.

### Next steps

You can publish the package from this workspace to npm, but you'll need to make
a few changes to improve its portability. Instead of shipping raw `.vue` files
we can use a bundler to generate a pure js entrypoint. I recommend `parcel` as
a simple, batteries included bundler, but you could also go with something
popular in the Vue community such as `vite`. Then you need to change
`package.json#main` to point to your compiled bundle, something like
`./dist/index.js`.
